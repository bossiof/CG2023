# CG2023
Computer Graphics project for the year 2023 at Politecnico di Milano.

The group project consisted in a small space game made with Vulkan to use the concepts learnt during the course

## Makefile

The Mmakefile is a modified version of [tomdaley92/makefile](https://gist.github.com/tomdaley92/190c68e8a84038cc91a5459409e007df) that allows for structured projects and manage shader compilation

## Ideas

- [x] Simil racing game (pass through portals/rings in the air)
- [x] Optional collision with obstacles
- [x] Basic movement logic
- [x] S P E E D effect
- [x] Space setting
- [x] Model sun as point light
- [x] Different planet/object models
- [x] Skybox effects with shaders
- [x] Implement movement inertia
